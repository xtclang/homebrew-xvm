============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Ecstasy Project. By
participating in this project, you agree to abide by our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Pull requests are welcome. Documentation changes do not require a
contributor agreement.

Code submissions (new or modified code) do require a contributor agreement.
To keep things simple for legal purposes, The Ecstasy Project uses the same
contributor agreements as the Apache Software Foundation, but modified to
refer to The Ecstasy Project. For information about the basis and purpose
of our contributor agreements, see
[Apache Contributor Agreements](https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html).

_(Our apologies in advance for the hassle, but we need to be very careful 
about potential IP issues, based on the same fundamental concerns that 
Apache has. Thank you for your understanding.)_

## Contribution guidelines ##

* _Cleanliness is next to godliness._ It is very difficult to clean things up, and very easy to make a mess, so we ask that contributions always move us in the direction of cleaning things up, and we will have to respectfully decline contributions that fail to meet that measure.
* Fixes should include a test, and features should include a working example. We apologize in advance for not having followed this rule in the early stages of the project.
* Until an official style guide is published, please respect the styles already in use.
* We are attempting to follow the [Git Strict Flow and GitHub Project Guidelines](https://gist.github.com/rsp/057481db4dbd999bb7077f211f53f212)
